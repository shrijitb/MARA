Regime-Gated Capital Allocator.

Maps the current market regime → worker allocation weights, adjusted for:
  - Worker health (unhealthy workers get 0 regardless of regime profile)
  - Worker performance (Sharpe below MIN_SHARPE cuts allocation in half)
  - Cash buffer (enforced minimum reserve, scaled up in crisis regimes)

Worker keys match docker-compose service names exactly:
    arbitrader  — Java cross-exchange price arb (delta-neutral, port 8004)
    nautilus    — NautilusTrader strategies incl. MACD/Fractals swing (port 8001)
    polymarket  — CLOB market-making (port 8002)
    autohedge   — AI advisory pipeline, Director+Quant+Risk (port 8003)

NOTE: swing_trend is NOT a separate worker. Swing strategies run inside
NautilusTrader (workers/nautilus/) and are allocated via the 'nautilus' key.
