# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-15)

**Core value:** No silent failure reaches Phase 3 — every bug, race condition, and untested safety path is found and fixed before live trading begins.
**Current focus:** Phase 5 — Test Coverage Expansion

## Current Position

Phase: 5 of 7 (Test Coverage Expansion)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-04-16 — Phases 1–4 verified complete; planning docs updated

Progress: [████████░░] 57%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 4 phases
- Average duration: -
- Total execution time: -

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Critical Bug Fixes     | Done  | -     | -        |
| 2. Missing Critical Features | Done | -  | -        |
| 3. Safety Rails Coverage  | Done  | -     | -        |
| 4. Security Hardening     | Done  | -     | -        |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: phases 1–4 complete
- Trend: on track

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- [Roadmap]: Bugs before tests — BUG-01 through BUG-08 must precede test coverage phases to ensure tests run against correct behavior
- [Roadmap]: FEAT-01 (dashboard endpoint) placed in Phase 2 before safety rail tests so COVER-05 (setup endpoint tests) can test the live endpoint
- [Roadmap]: SEC (security) after SAFE (safety rails) because safety rail tests in Phase 3 validate auth.py behavior (SAFE-05) first
- [Roadmap]: QUAL (code quality) placed after test coverage so fragile patterns can be caught by the expanded test suite
- [Roadmap]: Stress test is the final gate — no Phase 3 work until STRESS-02 verdict is written
- [Phase 4 Audit 2026-04-16]: All three SEC requirements were already implemented in code before this audit; ROADMAP.md was simply never updated after the work was done. Evidence: CORS restricted to localhost:3000/5173 (main.py:375-384), atomic .env write via os.replace() (main.py:1019-1021), docker-socket-proxy in docker-compose.yml (lines 33-43).

### Test Suite Baseline (2026-04-16)

- **299 passed, 10 skipped, 0 failed** — confirmed against live codebase
- Test files: test_mara.py, test_integration_dryrun.py, test_safety_rails.py, test_concurrency.py
- Phase 5 target: 150+ passing (COVER-08)

### Pending Todos

None yet for Phase 5.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 5]: COVER-06 — `di_container.py` `Hypervisor` class is still dead code; must be wired or deleted before Phase 5 closes
- [Phase 5]: COVER-08 — test count currently at 299 (already exceeds 150 target); confirm count includes all required coverage areas
- [Phase 6]: QUAL-01 (nautilus data feed isolation) requires Docker build context change — test carefully to avoid breaking Pi ARM64 builds
